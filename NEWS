neotoma 1.5.0
====================
o More extensive testing to support multiple dataset types.  Water chemistry datasets still unsupported.
o Function `read.tilia` added to read Tilia (http://tiliait.com) style XML files.
o Moved to using `xml2`, `httr` and `jsonlite` to support parsing.

neotoma 1.4.0
====================
o The few records without chronologies were causing errors when `get_download` was applied.
o Added plot method.

neotoma 1.3.3
====================
o Critical bug fix: `get_download` now correctly assigns the default chronology to `sample.meta`.  All other chronologies (including the default) are stored in the `chronologies` list for the `download`.
o Bugfix for issue #187, empty `dataset_list`s now return a NULL value, rather than breaking the `print` method.

neotoma 1.3.2
====================
o Bugfix for `get_download`, assignment to the `dataset.id` was incorrectly placed causing the columns to be out of place relative to the data.

neotoma 1.3.1
====================
o Bugfix for `write_agefile`
o Added a `browse` method for datasets, that will open a browser window for a specific dataset or download.
o The deprecated `compile_list` function has now been removed.  Use `compile_taxa` instead.

neotoma 1.3.0
====================
o Improved functionality of get_chroncontrol to allow it to deal with empty tables and work directly with download and download_list objects.

neotoma 1.2-0
====================
o Added new datasettypes for records, including water chemistry, charcoal, XRD and others.
